Quizz game about nation's flags. Try it at http://mrpeu.github.io/countrysqueeze/

*Heavely inspired by Android's game: [National flags quizz ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fractalgate.android.nationalflags)*

## Why?
Exercise. Practice React, Redux, PWA, JS
And maybe Webpack, sound API, router

## ToDo:
- [x] finish end of game
- [x] change the root of countries.json to be an object (instead of an array)
- [x] randomize "round's paging"
- [x] rename "answer" from player to "entry"
- [x] use cca2 as key for countries' list and array index for rounds and pages
- [x] merge App and Game
- [x] cache assets, offline support (service-worker)
- [ ] get rid of create-react-app, use webpack and gh-build directly
- [ ] randomize page & answer
- [ ] add timer
- [ ] read more about the service worker
- [ ] handle routing, sync game state with url [redux-little-router](https://github.com/formidablelabs/redux-little-router)
- [ ] add sounds
- [ ] use preact
